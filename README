Description
    This code provides models and solvers to realize coupled CFD-DEM simulations
    using LIGGGHTS and OpenFOAM.
    Note: this code is not part of OpenFOAM (see DISCLAIMER).
\*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


CFDEM(R) coupling provides an open source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework 
combining the strengths of the LIGGGHTS(R) DEM code and the Open Source 
CFD package OpenFOAM(R)(*). The CFDEM(R)coupling toolbox allows to expand 
standard CFD solvers of OpenFOAM(R)(*) to include a coupling to the DEM 
code LIGGGHTS(R). In this toolbox the particle representation within the 
CFD solver is organized by "cloud" classes. Key functionalities are organised 
in sub-models (e.g. force models, data exchange models, etc.) which can easily 
be selected and combined by dictionary settings.

The coupled solvers run fully parallel on distributed-memory clusters. 

Features are:

- its modular approach allows users to easily implement new models
- its MPI parallelization enables to use it for large scale problems
- the use of GIT allows to easily update to the latest version
- basic documentation is provided

The file structure:

- "src" directory including the source files of the coupling toolbox and models
- "applications" directory including the solver files for coupled CFD-DEM simulations
- "doc" directory including the documentation of CFDEM(R)coupling
- "tutorials" directory including basic tutorial cases showing the functionality



Details on installation are given on the "www.cfdem.com"

The functionality of this CFD-DEM framwork is described via "tutorial cases" showing 
how to use different solvers and models.

CFDEM(R)coupling stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -
Discrete Element Method (DEM) coupling.

CFDEM(R)coupling is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the 
GNU Public License (GPL).

Core development of CFDEM(R)coupling is done by 
Christoph Goniva and Christoph Kloss, both at DCS Computing GmbH, 2012
